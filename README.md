# Swarm Simulation

This repository contains a simple Python program that simulates a swarm of red dots on a black background. The user can place a single flag by clicking the mouse, and the dots will attempt to move toward that flag. Only one red dot can occupy a pixel at any time.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/)

Install Pygame using pip:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

## Running

Execute the simulation with:

```bash
python swarm.py
```

Click anywhere in the window to place the target flag for the swarm.
